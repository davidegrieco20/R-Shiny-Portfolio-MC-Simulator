# 📈 R/Shiny Portfolio & Monte Carlo Simulator

A dynamic and interactive web application built with **R/Shiny** for performing quantitative finance analysis. This tool allows users to define an equity portfolio, compare its performance and risk metrics against the **S&P 500 (^GSPC)** benchmark, and model future performance using **Monte Carlo simulation**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Custom Portfolio Analysis:** Define a portfolio using up to 5 user-specified stock tickers and custom asset weights.
* **Real-Time Data Retrieval:** Fetches historical daily return data from Yahoo Finance using the `quantmod` package.
* **Historical Performance Visualization:** Charts the cumulative returns of your portfolio versus the S&P 500.
* **Comprehensive Risk & Performance Metrics:** Calculates and compares key metrics:
    * Daily/Total Returns and Annualized Volatility.
    * Sharpe Ratio (Daily & Annualized).
    * CAPM metrics: **Alpha** and **Beta** relative to the S&P 500.
* **Probabilistic Forecasting (Monte Carlo):** Integrates a **Monte Carlo Simulation** to project future pure portfolio returns, showing the median expected path and the **95% confidence interval** (using a Geometric Brownian Motion model based on historical parameters).

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

You must have **R** and **RStudio** installed on your system.

1.  [Install R (The R Project for Statistical Computing)](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
2.  [Install RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/davidegrieco20/R-Shiny-Portfolio-MC-Simulator.git](https://github.com/davidegrieco20/R-Shiny-Portfolio-MC-Simulator.git)
    ```

2.  **Open the Project:**
    Navigate to the cloned directory and open the project in RStudio.

3.  **Install Required Packages:**
    Open the R Console (in RStudio) and install all necessary dependencies:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("shiny", "quantmod", "PerformanceAnalytics", "tidyverse", "xts"))
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
